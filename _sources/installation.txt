Installation
============

I don't know how to create python .egg package, so for now you can install the application by cloning it from github.

After cloning, add ``grid`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

Also, make sure that you have ``request`` context processor added to ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``:
::

  from django.conf.global_settings import TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS as TCP

  TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = TCP + (
      'django.core.context_processors.request'
  )
