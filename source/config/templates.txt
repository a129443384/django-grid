Grid templates
==============
The grid uses it's default templates. It is almost certain, that you would like to override them, in order to match your desired css / html convention.

If you want to override the template, you need to create the following structure:
::

    . (project directory)
    ├── manage.py
    └── templates
        └── grid

And you put your custom templates inside the ``templates/grid`` directory.

Object's list - ``object_list.html``
------------------------------------
This is the template, that renders the grid itself. It has a for loop over the items. It also displays 'no items found' via td with a colspan.

Pagination - ``pagination.html``
--------------------------------
This is the grid's pagination plugin.
