Introduction
============

I created this application in order to easily display data from multiple sources:

* Django model's (Querysets)
* MongoDB (Non model data)
* Results from my non-model-full-text-search application

I was searching for such application, but failed to find one that would fit my needs. There was one application, but it required
for setting the whole display logic in python code, which i wasn't very keen to do. I wanted to use django's default pagination plugin.

If you are visiting the docs, this means that you either have similar needs, or are quite desperate.. :)

Let me clarify that there are parts of the code (especially ``templates/grid/paginator.html``) which i'm not satisfied with. (In this particular
file i create the links dynamically, but with ugly template filters). If you know how to do it better, please feel free to help me.
